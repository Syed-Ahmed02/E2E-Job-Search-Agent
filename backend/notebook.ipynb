However, several Vancouver listings show “No longer accepting applications” in the snippets I found, so I didn’t include those as active. If you want, I can run a deeper search focused specifically on Canada (Vancouver, Toronto) to pull currently active SWE roles with clear apply links.\n",
      "- GitHub / Visual Studio / Microsoft 365 / Xbox gaming focus: The roles above so far emphasize Azure/Cloud and Windows, with a notable Microsoft Gaming principal role in Cloud Services (which aligns with Xbox/Cloud gaming interests). If you want explicit listings in GitHub or Visual Studio teams, I can run a targeted search for those titles and teams and pull direct apply links.\n",
      "- How I’ll expand if you want more options: I can broaden the search to include (a) more Seattle/Redmond-area roles that show hybrid work with SDE I/II/III/Staff levels, (b) additional Canada postings (Toronto/Vancouver) that are active, and (c) roles in Windows, Microsoft 365, and Visual Studio areas, ensuring the postings show a direct apply link and current status.\n",
      "\n",
      "What would you like me to do next?\n",
      "- I can keep digging to fill up to 15 active roles, including more Canada postings and any GitHub/Visual Studio/Microsoft 365/Windows/Xbox entries that show hybrid options.\n",
      "- I can also filter further by exact level (SDE I, II, III, Staff) if you want a stricter alignment to a particular stage in your career.\n",
      "- Or, I can go deeper into Canada (Toronto/Vancouver) and Seattle/Greater Seattle, then present a second, larger list with clear apply links and short reasons for each.\n",
